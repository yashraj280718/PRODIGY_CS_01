# Image Encryption Tool

A powerful desktop application for encrypting and decrypting images using multiple algorithms. Built with Python, Tkinter, and PIL, this tool provides an intuitive graphical interface for secure image processing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User-friendly GUI** with side-by-side image preview
- **Four encryption algorithms**:
  - **XOR Encryption** - Bitwise XOR operations with key-generated sequences
  - **Pixel Swap** - Deterministic pixel position shuffling
  - **Mathematical** - Modular arithmetic operations with multiplicative inverses
  - **Color Channel Shift** - RGB channel value shifting
- **Supports multiple formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF
- **Custom encryption keys** for personalized security
- **Real-time preview** of original and processed images
- **Save functionality** for encrypted/decrypted results
- **Reset option** to clear all images and start fresh

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshot

The application features a clean, organized interface with:
- File selection panel
- Encryption method dropdown
- Key input field
- Control buttons (Encrypt, Decrypt, Save, Reset)
- Side-by-side image display
- Status bar for operation feedback

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Required Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy
```

Or install from requirements.txt (if available):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-tool.git
cd image-encryption-tool
```

## üéØ Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Load an Image**
   - Click "Select Image" button
   - Choose your image file from the file dialog
   - The original image will appear in the left panel

2. **Choose Encryption Method**
   - Select from the dropdown menu:
     - XOR (default)
     - Pixel Swap
     - Mathematical
     - Color Channel Shift

3. **Set Encryption Key**
   - Enter your custom key in the text field
   - Default key is "12345"
   - Use the same key for decryption

4. **Encrypt the Image**
   - Click "Encrypt Image" button
   - Encrypted result appears in the right panel

5. **Decrypt the Image**
   - Click "Decrypt Image" button (with the same key)
   - Decrypted result replaces the processed image

6. **Save Results**
   - Click "Save Result" to export the processed image
   - Choose location and format (PNG/JPG)

7. **Reset**
   - Click "Reset" to clear all images and start over

## üîê Encryption Algorithms

### XOR Encryption
- Uses bitwise XOR operations with a deterministic key sequence
- Symmetric algorithm (same process for encryption/decryption)
- Fast and simple implementation

### Pixel Swap
- Rearranges pixel positions based on key-generated shuffle sequence
- Maintains image data integrity while scrambling appearance
- Reversible with the correct key

### Mathematical
- Applies modular arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition)
- Uses modular multiplicative inverse for decryption
- Ensures mathematical reversibility

### Color Channel Shift
- Shifts RGB channel values by key-derived amounts
- Preserves image structure while altering colors
- Lightweight and efficient
